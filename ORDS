#How to check ORDS version from APEX builder
----------------------------------------------------
select owa_util.get_cgi_env('APEX_LISTENER_VERSION') 
from dual;

select ords.installed_version 
from dual

## ORDS configuration-1 ##
----------------------------------------------------
# add one line to the file global/settings.xml in the ORDS configuration directory:
<entry key="security.forceHTTPS">true</entry>

One symptom that this parameter is needed is that APEX works OK, but the redirect_uri that APEX sends as a parameter in the request to your OpenID Connect provider contains port 80 in an URI that starts with https://.

## ORDS configuration-2 ##
----------------------------------------------------
# Default behavior can be disabled in environments where HTTPS is not available as follows:

1. Locate the folder where the Oracle REST Data Services configuration is stored.

2.Edit the file named defaults.xml.

3.Add the following setting to the end of this file just before the </properties> tag.

 <entry key="security.verifySSL">false</entry>

4.Save the file.

5.Restart Oracle REST Data Services if it is running.

Note that it is only appropriate to use this setting in development or test environments. 
It is never appropriate to use this setting in production environments because it will result in user credentials being passed in clear text.
